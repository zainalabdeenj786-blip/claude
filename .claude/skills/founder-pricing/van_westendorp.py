"""Price sensitivity (Van Westendorp) for founder-pricing. Standard library only.

Every buyer on the panel answers four questions: at what price would it be too
cheap to trust, a bargain, getting expensive, and too expensive to buy. Plotted
together, those four answers give you an acceptable price range and the price
that leaves the fewest people unhappy.

    python3 van_westendorp.py founder/panel/answers
    python3 van_westendorp.py prices.csv --out founder/pricing-curve.md
    python3 van_westendorp.py founder/panel/answers --json

Input is either the panel's answers folder (one JSON per buyer, written by
founder-consumer) or a CSV with the columns too_cheap, cheap, expensive,
too_expensive (one row per respondent; extra columns are ignored). A respondent
missing any of the four numbers, or giving them out of order (too cheap must be
the lowest, too expensive the highest), is dropped and counted.

The four points it reports:

    PMC  point of marginal cheapness   below this, too many think it's too cheap
    PME  point of marginal expensiveness above this, too many think it's too expensive
    OPP  optimal price point            as many say "too cheap" as "too expensive"
    IPP  indifference price point       as many say "a bargain" as "expensive"

PMC to PME is the acceptable range. These are answers from simulated buyers:
use the range to choose what to TEST, then test it with real ones.
